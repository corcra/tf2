Data processing:
    - what features to use? (what window size to take?)
    - functions to obtain these
    - isolate corresponding DNA sequence, recode
    - get other-TF-binding from ChIP-seq, hardcode it in for now

EM implementation:
    - move the binding calculation outside the EM loop
    - calculate the thetas after the peak loop
    - implement intelligent parameter-passing to the peak-specific HMMs
    - in fact, just remember peak-specific transitions!
    - wrap more things in functions? wrap everything in functions

Optimisation:
    - parallelise?

Testing:
    - create positive test set from ChIP-seq
    - test on DNA alone, with interactions
